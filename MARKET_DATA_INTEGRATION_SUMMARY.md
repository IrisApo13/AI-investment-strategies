- Recent price and volume trends

### 2. Enhanced Strategy Generation Prompts

**Initial Strategy Prompt** now includes:

    max_iterations=3,
    target_score=70.0
)
```

### With Enhanced Feedback
```python
from config.settings import Config

# Enable advanced feedback with market data
Config.FEEDBACK_STATEGY = "advanced_feedback"

)
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Test market data integration
