I want to build an AI system that help me do backtesting of investment strategies. 
An investment stategy tells me when is a good time to buy or sell a stock

I want to build this in python and using the OpenAI API for LLM. 

The program will accept a stock ticker, it will ask the LLM for an investment strategy considering
stock prices from the last 10 years. Then I will need to run a backtest on this strategy and 
determine if this strategy worked well or not. 

if this strategy did not work, I will ask the LLM to explain why and then I will 
give this feedback back to the LLM to ask for a better strategy in a loop. 
In each iteration of the loop I will ask the user if he wants to continue or stop.
